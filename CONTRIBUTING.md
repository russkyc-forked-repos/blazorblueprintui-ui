## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please create an issue on GitHub:

1. Check if the issue already exists
2. Use the issue template if available
3. Provide a clear description and reproduction steps for bugs
4. For feature requests, explain the use case and expected behavior

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our code style guidelines
3. **Test your changes** across different Blazor hosting models (Server, WASM, Hybrid)
4. **Update documentation** if you're adding new features or changing behavior
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your changes

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **.NET 8 SDK** or later
- **Git** for version control
- **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022, VS Code, or Rider (recommended)
- **Tailwind CSS standalone CLI** (included in demo app, no Node.js required)

### Clone and Build

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blazorblueprintui/ui.git
cd ui
```

2. **Build the solution:**

```bash
dotnet build
```

This builds all five NuGet packages:
- `BlazorBlueprint.Components` - Styled components
- `BlazorBlueprint.Primitives` - Headless primitives
- `BlazorBlueprint.Icons.Lucide` - Lucide icon library
- `BlazorBlueprint.Icons.Heroicons` - Heroicons library
- `BlazorBlueprint.Icons.Feather` - Feather icon library

### Run the Demo Application

```bash
cd demo/BlazorBlueprint.Demo
dotnet watch run
```

The demo app will be available at `https://localhost:5001`

**Note:** The demo includes Tailwind CSS setup and shows all components with live examples.

## Code Style Guidelines

Blazor Blueprint follows the coding standards documented in `.devflow/constitution.md`. Key guidelines:

### Naming Conventions
- **PascalCase** for public members, types, and namespaces
- **camelCase** for private fields (no underscore prefix)
- Component files: `ComponentName.razor` + `ComponentName.razor.cs`

### Documentation
- Add XML documentation for all public APIs
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Update README.md for new components

### Code Quality
- Follow Blazor best practices
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Properly dispose of resources
- Use null-safety throughout

### Accessibility
- All components must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Support keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, please:

- Test across Blazor Server, WebAssembly, and Hybrid
- Verify cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Validate accessibility with keyboard navigation
- Check that all components render correctly in light and dark mode
