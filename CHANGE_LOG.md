---

## 2026-02-10

### Added
- `Strategy` and `ZIndex` parameters on `PopoverContent` — allows dropdowns to use `fixed` positioning and custom z-index to escape stacking contexts (e.g., inside Dialogs)
- Dialog demo expanded with Select, Combobox, and MultiSelect controls to demonstrate nested portal behavior
- DataTable demo added "Dialog with Combobox in Cell Template" section as a nested portal regression test
- API surface snapshot tests for Components and Primitives assemblies using Verify — detects unintentional public API changes
- `run-tests.sh` script for running API surface tests locally
- API surface tests integrated into NuGet publish CI workflow

### Changed
- Combobox selected item checkmark moved from left side to right side of the item text

### Fixed
- Portal render timeout warnings when floating content is nested inside other portals (e.g., Combobox inside Dialog) — `NotifyPortalRendered` now fires before processing deferred rerenders in `PortalHost`
- Combobox and MultiSelect dropdowns now render correctly above Dialog overlays using `fixed` positioning with elevated z-index
- `DialogPortal` not refreshing content on re-render — event handlers inside dialog content would update state but the UI wouldn't re-render until an unrelated browser event occurred (#118)
- `SheetPortal` using `UpdatePortalContent` instead of `RefreshPortal`, which unnecessarily replaced the RenderFragment delegate on every parameter update
- Disabled Verify auto-launching diff tool on test failure
- Resolved analyzer errors in test project
- Removed obsolete `[UsesVerify]` attribute from test classes
- Infinite render loop in `PortalHost` when opening dropdown controls (Select, Combobox, MultiSelect) inside a Dialog — replaced `_pendingRerender` flag with structural change detection to break the loop that froze WASM apps

---

## 2026-02-09

### Added
- Control-specific `FormField` wrapper components: `FormFieldCheckbox`, `FormFieldSwitch`, `FormFieldRadioGroup`, `FormFieldSelect`, `FormFieldCombobox`, and `FormFieldMultiSelect` — pre-configured FormField wrappers that simplify EditForm integration for non-text controls
- `FormFieldBase` base class providing shared EditForm/EditContext integration, validation, label, description, and error message rendering
- `FormFieldInput` component for typed text input with built-in form field layout (label, description, validation messages)
- Flag icon and avatar examples in `FormFieldSelect` demo
- Demo pages for each FormField wrapper in the Components sidebar section
- EditForm integration for `InputField` components with cascading `EditContext` support

### Fixed
- Build errors related to FormField component integration
- Added `string` type to `GetFriendlyTypeName` in FormField for proper type display
- DateRangePicker popover layout responsive on mobile devices (single-month view with horizontal preset scrolling)
- DateRangePicker day name headers now rotate correctly based on `FirstDayOfWeek` parameter
- DateRangePicker no longer highlights disabled dates within a selected range
- DateRangePicker selected day count excludes disabled dates
- DateRangePicker presets are ignored when all dates in the range are disabled

---

## 2026-02-08

### Added
- `CursorType` enum and `CursorExtensions.ToClass()` utility for mapping cursor types to Tailwind CSS classes

- `UpdateTiming` enum for Input and InputField — `Immediate` (default), `OnChange` (blur/Enter), and `Debounced` modes
- `DebounceInterval` parameter (default 500ms) for debounced value updates
- `UpdateTiming` and `DebounceInterval` parameters on `Textarea`, `InputGroupInput`, and `InputGroupTextarea` — matching the `Input` component pattern
- `DisableDebounce` and `DebounceInterval` parameters on `CommandInput`, `NumericInput<T>`, and `CurrencyInput` — debounce ON by default with selective immediate firing on blur/arrow keys
- Update Timing / Debounce demo sections with live value displays on Textarea, InputGroup, Command, NumericInput, and CurrencyInput demo pages
- InputField demo page with examples for all supported types and features
- `SetPosition()` and `ResetPosition()` methods on `ToastService` for runtime toast position control
- `TimelineConnectorFit` enum with `Spaced` and `Connected` options for controlling how connector lines fit between icons
- `ConnectorFit` parameter on `Timeline` component
- `ConnectorClass` parameter on `TimelineItem` for custom connector height overrides
- `Loading` parameter on `TimelineIcon` for isolated pulse animation
- Rich Content, Connector Fit, and Custom Connector Height demo sections for Timeline
- EditForm and EditContext integration for 14 input components (`Input`, `Textarea`, `InputGroupInput`, `InputGroupTextarea`, `NumericInput`, `CurrencyInput`, `MaskedInput`, `Select`, `Combobox`, `NativeSelect`, `DatePicker`, `TimePicker`, `ColorPicker`, `InputOTP`) — cascading `EditContext`, `ValueExpression`, field validation tracking, and merged `aria-invalid` state
- `Name` parameter on text input components with auto-fallback to `FieldIdentifier` for SSR form postback support
- Form Validation demo sections on 12 component demo pages showing EditForm with `DataAnnotationsValidator` and `ValidationMessage`

### Changed
- Button component now shows `cursor-pointer` by default and `disabled:cursor-not-allowed` when disabled, replacing `disabled:pointer-events-none` for better UX feedback
- Added Salary column with currency format (`C0`) to the DataTable demo Basic Table example
- Command palette keyboard shortcut changed from `Ctrl+K` to `Ctrl+I` across demo pages to avoid browser address bar conflict
- `CommandDemo` refactored to use `IKeyboardShortcutService` instead of raw JS interop for Ctrl+I shortcut registration

### Fixed
- DataTable global search now uses the column's `Format` string when converting values for search matching, consistent with how cell values are rendered
- Text input components (`Input`, `Textarea`, `InputGroupInput`, `InputGroupTextarea`) now normalize empty/whitespace strings to `null`, preventing inconsistent validation on nullable string properties (#99)
- Dropdown mispositioning when switching between multiple open MultiSelect components
- Stale portal content when interacting inside open popovers
- ContextMenu keyboard navigation breaking on repeated right-clicks on the same trigger
- Toast positioning demo now interactive with live position switching

- Timeline loading pulse animation no longer bleeds through icon ring onto connector line
- Timeline collapsible item chevrons now align consistently regardless of title length
- Menubar demo icon name corrected from `check-circle` to `circle-check`
- Timeline connector `z-index` changed from `z-10` to `z-[1]` to prevent overlap with overlays
- Timeline connector minimum height increased from `min-h-8` to `min-h-16` for better spacing

### Changed

### Fixed
- Infinite render loop when FloatingPortal is nested inside Dialog (e.g., Combobox in Dialog) — removed re-registration in `OnParametersSet` to match DialogPortal pattern
- Migrated all components to `ClassNames.cn()` for proper TailwindMerge support
- TailwindMerge incorrectly classified `border-dashed`, `border-dotted`, and `border-l-2` as border-color utilities, causing them to be dropped during class merging
